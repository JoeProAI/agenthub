## 🎯 Strategic Credit Usage

### Daytona.io ($20,000 credits) - Development Infrastructure

**Optimal Use Cases:**
1. **Team Development Workspaces**
   - Pre-configured Next.js + Firebase environments
   - Instant onboarding for new developers
   - No local setup required

2. **Agent Testing Sandboxes**
   - Isolated environments per agent
   - Safe testing of experimental features
   - Reproducible test scenarios

3. **CI/CD Runners**
   - Faster build times than GitHub Actions free tier
   - Parallel test execution
   - Custom deployment pipelines

4. **Collaboration Environments**
   - Real-time pair programming
   - Code reviews in live environments
   - Demo environments for stakeholders

**Estimated Usage**: $2,000-3,000/month value = 6-10 months of premium dev infrastructure

### Modal ($500 credits) - Production Compute

**Optimal Use Cases:**
1. **Video Summarizer Agent** (Highest value)
   - Whisper API for transcription
   - Long video processing (30min+ videos)
   - Batch processing of user videos
   - Estimated: 100-200 video generations

2. **Data Analyst Agent**
   - Large CSV/dataset processing
   - Complex ML inference
   - Pandas/NumPy heavy operations
   - Estimated: 500-1000 analysis jobs

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Nightly report generation
   - Scheduled content processing
   - Bulk API operations
   - Background job processing

4. **Model Inference**
   - Custom ML models too heavy for Vercel functions
   - Image generation (if not using OpenAI)
   - Audio processing
   - Large language model fine-tuning

**Estimated Usage**: 
- $500 = ~50 hours of compute
- Video processing: ~200 videos
- Data analysis: ~1000 jobs
- 3-6 months of production workload

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Lint Errors in IDE
**Status**: ✅ Expected - Not a problem  
**Reason**: Dependencies not installed locally  
**Solution**: Will auto-resolve on Vercel deployment, or run `npm install` for local dev

### Issue: Firebase connection fails
**Check**: Environment variables in Vercel dashboard  
**Verify**: All `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` vars are set  
**Test**: Firebase Console → Authentication tab should show your project

### Issue: Stripe webhook not receiving events
**Check**: Webhook URL matches deployment URL  
**Verify**: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe dashboard  
**Test**: Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Send test event

### Issue: Agent execution fails
**Check**: OpenAI API key is valid and has credits  
**Verify**: User has sufficient credits in Firestore  
**Debug**: Check Vercel function logs for errors
